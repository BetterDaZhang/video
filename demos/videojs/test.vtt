2
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Zach Galifianakis> Hi, my name is 
Zach Galifianakis.

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Zach Galifianakis> Welcome to another addition 
 of Between Two Ferns.

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Zach Galifianakis> My guess is Will Ferrell.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.830
- Will: Hey. 
 - Zach: Hey man.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.810
- Will: What's up? 
 - Zach: What's up?

7
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.280
- Will: Great to see you. 
 - Zach: Nice to see you too.

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.680
- Will: Thanks for having me. It's fun. 
 - Zach: You look great. 

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Will Ferrell> Thank you.

10
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Zach Galifianakis> You look really good.

11
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.170
- Will: Likewise. 
 - Zach: Yeah.

12
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Zach Galifianakis> We've really never had a 
 sit down, one on one--

13
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Zach Galifianakis> I think we had that lunch one time.

14
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Will Ferrell> We did have a lunch, right, in New York?

15
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.990
<v Zach Galifianakis> You're a big lunch guy too. 

16
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Will Ferrell> Yep.

17
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Zach Galifianakis> I knew that was the case.

18
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.360
 

19
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Zach Galifianakis> Everything Must Go, is kind 
 of a departure for you right.

20
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Will Ferrell> Yeah. You've done a little
 bit of that where

21
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.010
<v Will Ferrell> you get to do a more serious...

22
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Zach Galifianakis> You do one for them, and 
 you do one for you.

23
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Will Ferrell> Right. 

24
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.580
- Zach: Yeah, that's the kind of... 
 - Will: Bones it out. 

25
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.030
<v Zach Galifianakis> Um.

26
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Zach Galifianakis> Uh.

27
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Zach Galifianakis> Oh God, that really hurt.

28
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Will Ferrell> Did that-- 
 I'm sorry. Did that hurt you?

29
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.720
<v Will Ferrell> I felt like we barely touched.

30
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Zach Galifianakis> Should we see a clip?

31
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:08.930
(foreign language is spoken) 
 (a child in the background is whining)

32
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Zach Galifianakis> That was good.

33
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.680
- Will: There you have it. 
 - Zach: Yeah. 

34
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Will Ferrell> And just to be real clear 
 with the audience,

35
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Will Ferrell> that's the part of the film 
 where the monkey grabs

36
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Will Ferrell> a frog to suck on his genitals. 

37
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Zach Galifianakis> Right. I think this is 
 going pretty well so far.

38
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Will Ferrell> I'm having a great time.

39
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Zach Galifianakis> Yeah, it's nice to have you 
 here. Do you mind 

40
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Zach Galifianakis> if I do a little word from the sponsor? 

41
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Will Ferrell> Oh no, not at all. Yeah. You gotta...

42
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.030
 

43
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Zach Galifianakis> Okay.

44
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.800
 

45
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Zach Galifianakis> Handle it. 

46
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.070
 

47
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Will Ferrell> Man and Speed Stick.

48
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Will Ferrell> I actually have a 
sponsor as well-- 

49
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Zach Galifianakis> Oh, really?

50
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Will Ferrell> --If you wouldn't mind 
indulging me. It's Charlie.

51
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Zach Galifianakis> It's a women's perfume. 

52
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Will Ferrell> It's a woman's perfume.

53
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Zach Galifianakis> Does it smell good? 

54
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Will Ferrell> It's pungent. 
 I'll just leave it at that.

55
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.050
- Zach: Yeah. 
 - Will: Yeah.

56
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.680
 

57
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Zach Galifianakis> In your down time, what 
 do you get up to?

58
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.770
<v Will Ferrell> Well, I like to do a lot of 
 work with the community. The--

59
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.990
 

60
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Zach Galifianakis> What's going on?

61
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.190
Kid: You're fat.

62
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.330
 

63
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Will Ferrell> Can I just stop you real 
 quick, and just say,

64
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.480
<v Will Ferrell> what a wonderful atmosphere 
you have here. 

65
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Will Ferrell> It's a great set. It's a great vibe--

66
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Will Ferrell> Great incredible spread. 
 In fact, I was having--

67
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Will Ferrell> Can you bring up some of those 
 cherries over?

68
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Will Ferrell> I was having some of these 
 cherries--

69
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Will Ferrell> Have you tried any of these 
 cherries?

70
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.352
<v Will Ferrell> Just take one bite of this.

71
00:02:35.372 --> 00:02:37.890


72
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Will Ferrell> Is that not the nicest cherry?

73
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.508
<v Zach Galifianakis> Mmm.

74
00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:46.060


75
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Zach Galifianakis> Do you have the--

76
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Zach Galifianakis> Thank you. 

77
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:59.930
 

78
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.960
<v Zach Galifianakis> You okay? 
Let me help you with it.

79
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:19.080


80
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.530
<v Zach Galifianakis> What is your favorite app?

81
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Will Ferrell> Oddly enough...

82
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.710
<v Jon Hamm> Um, did I leave my keys here?

83
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.530
<v Zach Galifianakis> What? 

84
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.270
<v Jon Hamm> My car keys. I can't find my keys.

85
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Zach Galifianakis> That was like two and a half 
 years ago. 

86
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Jon Hamm> Can I just look around. 

87
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.344
<v Zach Galifianakis> Yeah. 

88
00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:34.720


89
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Jon Hamm> Oh, I got them.
 Cool.

90
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Zach Galifianakis> Yeah. 

91
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Jon Hamm> See you guys.

92
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.216
<v Will Ferrell> Bye. 

93
00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:43.650


94
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.070
<v Zach Galifianakis> What kind of other things 
 do you do in your down time?

95
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Will Ferrell> I'm starting to manage 
 dance teams, hip-hop groups.

96
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Zach Galifianakis> Oh that's great.

97
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Will Ferrell> Yeah. Anywhere from 4-50 
 kids, and just a lot of 

98
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.500
<v Will Ferrell> energy, a lot of emotion, a 
 lot of fun, a lot of high-fivin', 
a lot of smiles.

99
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Zach Galifianakis> That's basically the 
mantra of it. It's like a

100
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.270
<v Zach Galifianakis> lot of high-fives. Is that 
 what you said?

101
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.800
<v Will Ferrell> I said, if you were listening, 
 a lot of emotion,

102
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Will Ferrell> a lot of high-fives, and a
 lot of smiles.

103
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.280
<v Will Ferrell> That's what I said.

104
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Will Ferrell> And I was pretty clear 
 about what I said. 

105
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Will Ferrell> I listen to what you're asking 
 me, and 

106
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.470
<v Will Ferrell> if you're not listening to 
 my answers lets just call it a day.

107
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.600
<v Zach Galifianakis> But the mantra is--

108
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Will Ferrell> Just shut up about the mantra. 

109
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Will Ferrell> Just shut up!

110
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.910
<v Will Ferrell> Okay!

111
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Zach Galifianakis> Yeah. 
 Okay.

112
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.580
<v Will Ferrell> If you can't get the 
 fat out of your ears,

113
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.980
<v Will Ferrell> and listen then why am I here. 

114
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Will Ferrell> Get the fucking fat out of 
 your ears!

115
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.830
<v Zach Galifianakis> Okay. You know what?
 I'm not that fat!

116
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.220
<v Zach Galifianakis> Okay?

117
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Zach Galifianakis> I'm not that fat!

118
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.319
<v Zach Galifianakis> I lost 9 pounds.

119
00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:47.920


120
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.870
(Will cracks up)

121
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.540
 

122
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Will Ferrell> Ow!

123
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.050
(show music plays)

124
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.608
